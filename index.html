Her background at the provincial and federal level, and her longstanding advocacy for sustainability, give her a unique perspective on government collaboration and the greening of technology. As we kick off the Digital Nations at FWD50, Minister Murray lays out her vision for digital government in Canada and around the globe.</span>

            <span class="session-track">Helmuth von Moltke said that "no plan of operations extends with any certainty beyond the first contact with the main hostile force." Mike Tyson put it more succinctly: "Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth." Digital services aren't as confrontational, but the lesson remains the same: Tactics and implementation are vastly different from theory and architecture. And the office of the CIO is where theory collides headlong with the realities of implementation. In this chain reaction panel, we'll join four leads from Digital Nations member countries as they lay out their journey to the highest levels of digital government, and discuss the tradeoffs of turning idealistic plans into concrete actions.</span>

            <span class="session-track">2020 has been a crucible for both government, and the platforms on which it relies. The public sector has shown it can react quickly, at scale, using tools that simply weren't available a decade ago. By tackling health, policy, and the economy digitally, we've also created a roadmap for the future of government in a digital age. But where do we go from here? Dr. Julia Glidden is no stranger to digital innovation. She ran the first publicly binding digital election, and in her role as Worldwide Public Sector CVP at Microsoft works closely with governments around the world to chart their digital transformation. Join Julia and FWD50 Chair Alistair Croll for a look at the lessons learned from 2020óand our newfound understanding of what's possible.</span>

            <span class="session-track">Never have we been so called as humanity to come together and awaken to the destruction our systems are causing and that we have been blindly building for decades. What we may be emerging upon is a greater awareness of our own fragility in economic, social and environmental systems that we do not control, we cannot predict and that will never be status quo again. In the spirit of building back better, this discussion will invite us to explore Indigenous wisdom and ways of being as a key to actually learning the lessons we are living today and innovating forward in a way that achieves living in right relation, as Indigenous peoples have for thousands of years on the land you walk today.</span>

            <span class="session-track">The future will not be like the past. Weíre at an inflection point where the decisions our societies make now can have an enormous impact on the course of the next few decades. Those of us in business and in government have difficult choices to make. And those choices have to be made with wildly uncertain futures in mind. We can no longer base our strategies on the old baselines of predictable consumer demand, globalization, office life and business travel, and access to talent, credit, or venture funding. In this talk,Tim OíReilly discusses some of the forces that are shaping the post-Covid future, what skills will be needed in that new world, and how scenario planning can help you develop a robust strategy that will hold up well against a range of possible outcomes.</span>

            <span class="session-track">Public sector innovation requires that we choose wisely from the fruits of technology, reaping their benefits while avoiding their risks. Digital transformation means balancing tradeoffs to improve services for citizens while protecting their freedoms and rights. The Digital Nations has working groups, some of which are focused on digital identity, data, and greening government. In this open working session, each working group presents a short "lightning talk" on their area of focus, followed by an open Q&A, as we tackle the most promisingóand polarizingótechnologies.</span>

            <span class="session-track">Although there is an excellent all-of-Canadian Government communications channel in Canada.ca, there is not a Service Canada experience online that provides anywhere near the level of user centricity or quality of client/customer service that our non-digital channels offer. People who want to self-serve online need an end to end, integrated and supported experience. Our team is taking a user-centric and design led approach to designing a Digital Channel for Service Canada. Our goal is to create a dignified, user-centric, responsive and integrated digital journey that delights, empowers and supports Canadians to get the government services and benefits you need and are entitled to. The Digital Channel will also include an operating model that supports users within channel, continuously innovates as part of BAU, and assumes constant change and responsiveness to new needs and challenges. We want to do the hard work to make it easy for Canadians, which means a shift away from the current state where the onus generally on end users to navigate the impossible landscape of ever-changing and necessarily siloed bureaucracy. We want your help to shape a digital channel for Service Canada, so it can be developed with the very people it needs to serve.</span>

            <span class="session-track">As the healthcare domain transitions from a standalone device domain to an industry of connected medical devices, more and more data is being transmitted electronically. Much of this data is classified as sensitive, particularly Patient Health Information (PHI). The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) brings many benefits such as faster and more accurate diagnosis', automated treatment and reduced healthcare delivery costs. However, IoMT also introduces a number of security and privacy risks. This presentation discusses some of the technological and regulatory challenges associated with assuring data privacy and security. COVID-19 put huge pressure on public services; speed, flexibility, security and scale became critical
    
    Public service organisations needed new services that could support massively increased demand.
    
    Those who work in the open and could leverage the cloud were better prepared:
    
    ∑ Reusing what works and leveraging common components allows digital service teams to respond to citizen needs in a matter of days, and at scale. Community collaboration is an important tool for building trust - We are all in this together: Governments donít compete so they can collaborate.

            <span class="session-track">Digital tech has an ambivalent relationship with the environment. The tech sector has recently begun to focus on the challenge of reducing greenhouse gas emissions as digital transformation accelerates, via the greening of IT and procurement. Beyond these critical issues loom larger challenges and opportunities. In this session, we explore one critical challenge: public governance of environmental data is not keeping pace with fast-paced private sector innovation in instrumentation and environmental data harvesting, raising unprecedented policy challenges for governments around the world. We also explore a promising opportunity: digital tech innovations are exponentially accelerating government's ability to engage in environmental monitoring, protection, and enforcement. These developments sit at the confluence of Canada's Innovation and Skills agenda, and its domestic and international environmental stewardship responsibilities--creating an exciting opportunity for driving innovation and renewing talent in the public sector and beyond.</span>

         <h3 class="session-title">THE HUMAN ELEMENT OF HEALTH DATA VISUALIZATION</h3>
            <span class="session-track">The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the first global crises universally communicated through data. We read dashboards, signed up for alerts, and scrolled through countless pieces of data journalism summarizing new studies in an effort to be more informed in the middle of a crisis. Plotting numbers on a chart implies a certain factfulness and objectivity in the data, but what we saw in the pandemic was just how uncertain and incomplete those data could be. Many of the challenges we faced as data designers in a pandemic echo the broader challenges of visualizing and communicating health information. Issues of interoperability or lags in reporting systems can leave us with incomplete information. Changes in any single measure can be shaped by many others, like the impact of testing on case counts). The wide variance in the adoption of robust, modern digital health architecture can shape the timeliness and completeness of the data and our ability to make cross-country comparisons. Aggregate statistics formed from these incomplete data influence individual decision making and policy setting. Perhaps most importantly: health information is intensely personal. Unlike statistics about budgets or infrastructure, records in health data typically represent people with individual stories that can shape the ethical weight of our design decisions. During this talk, explore the challenges we face visualizing and communicating often incomplete data in the midst of a global pandemic, and how that learning applies more broadly across all visualization of health information.</span>

            <span class="session-track">Trust in government is wavering around the world. Fake news, conspiracies, and a business model of outrage has ended reasonable discourse and healthy compromise. We can disagreeóbut we must agree on how to resolve those disagreements if we are to function in modern society. How do we govern in a post-trust world, where facts compete with outrage? The Civic Tech movement provides a possible solution. Working on the ground, hand-in-hand with public servants at the regional level, the Code for All movement spearheaded by Code for America has shown there's a "third way" between public- and private-sector innovation. In this chat with FWD50 chair Alistair Croll, Code for America CEO Amanda Renteria looks at civic tech, trust in government, and how we need to talk more about what's working and what's possible if we want to regain support for the public square.</span>

        <span class="session-track">The introduction of technology does not always have the salubrious effect desired. Local conditions, side- conditions, societal and cultural conditions have roles to play in the useful uptake of new technology intended to make lives better. Access to the Internet is a good case in point and has had mixed utility in the several decades of its existence. Vint will explore these issues briefly in an attempt to stimulate serious thinking about extracting the best outcomes from the investment in Internet access that is being made around the world.</span>

            <span class="session-track">Estonia has pioneered many digital government fundamentals. Now, in an ambitious project to unify government interactions, the country is launching a chatbotóa single agent that can interact conversationally with citizens. Getting this to work across disconnected departments, and presenting a consistent, accessible interface to users, is a huge challenge. In 2019, Estonia's CTO, Kristo Vaher, shared his plans with the FWD50 audience. This year, he returns with an update in a conversation with Kathy Pham. Kathy's background in computer science, civic tech, and inclusive design brings the ideal perspective to consider Estonia's project; in this session, Kathy and Kristo will discuss public sector product management, chatbots, and corralling the departments and suppliers needed to make this vision a reality.</span>

         <h3 class="session-title">IT TAKES A VILLAGE: THE ROLE OF ALLIES IN REAL INCLUSION</h3>
            <span class="session-track">The past decade has seen a dramatic increase in awareness around diversity and inclusion. Under-represented groups are finding a voice in the public square and the boardroom. But itís just the beginning.
    Itís not enough to give everyone a seat at the table. Often, those who are at a disadvantage have to advocate for themselvesóplacing additional burdens atop their already heavy load. To effect concrete change at scale, we need more than representation. We need allies.
    When those with power and authority in an organization advocate for diversity and inclusion, the results are widespread and significant. Such organizations make better decisions, have a larger talent pool from which to recruit, and reduce the chances of groupthink and bias.
    In this session, weíll look at the role of allies in promoting equality and inclusion. This is especially critical in male-dominated sectors such as technology, as well as those where diverse representation ensures that service delivery works for the most vulnerable and marginalized. Weíll cover:
    The case for diversity and alliances among leaders.
    Examples of what works best to produce actual, sustainable changes in organizational leadership.
    The motivations and messages that encourage allies to step forward.- What leaders can do to recruit, train, and support allies and measure the results of their efforts.</span>

            <span class="session-track">The pandemic has intensified reliance on digital systems. It has also taught us that ìnone of us are safe until all of us are safe,î and made us aware of the global toll of inequity and exclusion. While emerging technologies and associated practices can disrupt our norms; artificial intelligence and current data driven systems amplify, automate, and increase the efficiency of the patterns of the past. This includes the patterns of disparity and inequity. This global pause has offered an opportunity to question what we are accelerating towards. Does this disruption of the status quo offer a window of opportunity to fundamentally rethink how we plan, decide, determine truth, work and learn, so that we can collectively thrive? Do the individuals that have been excluded hold the insights we are missing? Pina and Jutta will offer provocative challenges to our current conventions.these great inventions move forward, there is the necessary attention put on all people to engage in the solution.</span>

            <span class="session-track">Business model concepts originated within entrepreneurship and e-commerce and have migrated to the public sector. But when translating these models to government, often the core logic gets lost in translation. How do we take the best from concepts like platform-as-a-service into government while avoiding the worst elements of tech giant behavior and public sector bureaucracy? This discussion will explore the most useful concepts that originate from business model logic but centered in key framing questions: How might we participate with users to define what it is that we value? When replicating and adapting a platform-as-a-service model, how are we creating conditions for developers and innovators to accelerate the creation of new products and services for constituents? How do we maintain commitments to person-centered design methodologies, agile implementation approaches, rigorous ethical review, and algorithmic auditing? How do we make explicit and inclusive the discussion of what values get embedded in tools?</span>

On the day we will create a space to delve into: As a public service, how do we build a sense of belonging within our organizations, across the public service ecosystem, for our users, and in wider society?</span>
